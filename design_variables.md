# Design quantities
## Tubes
- Number of tubes
- Number of passes
- Length
- Pitch? (simply maximise?)

## Baffles
- Number of baffles
- Baffle cut
- Baffle shape

# Derived quantities
- Mass flow rates (from pressure drop from compressor chics)
- Heat transfer coefficient

# Configuration space
- 12-24 tubes       (13)
- 1,2,4 tube passes  (3)
- 1,2 shell passes   (2)
- 5-15 baffles      (11)
- Total space: 858 configurations. 
- Estimated time to brute-force evaluate: 0.6 s.
